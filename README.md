 HelloWorld application demonstrating Java 8 skills and testing frameworks.

HelloWorld.java class to set message and get the messages having some logic implemented

TestHelloWorld.java class is written to test HelloWorld.java by writing Junit test cases.
  - Here I used @Before, @Test annotations where @before is used to execute only once used for creating object
  - @Test to test the business logic of HelloWorld program with help of assertion methods like assertEquals
